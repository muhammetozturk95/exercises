# todolist

To begin with, I used a repository that is "oguzhnduran/JavaScript-ToDo-List-Homework-2-Patika.dev" to create main structure of my project. That's why I want to thank him.

In this project, you will see a to do list application.

You can add you what to do. 

Input value must be string format. If you type a number or leave blank space or only click add, you see an error toast message on top-right.

If you type in string format, your input is added end of the list and its first letter is become uppercase even if you type with lowercase. At the same time, you will see a success toast message on top-right.

When you click on a list item, item will be toggling "checked". Click again, It will be turned into the first form.

Then, you will be able to delete the completed item by close button in right.
