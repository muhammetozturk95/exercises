# jsform-example

Here is my second javascript project!

In this project there is a form as you may see below. When you submited the form, There will occur a list that include your name, surname and age. Then form fields was reset. Thus, you are able to submit a new form.

If you input incomplete or incorrect information, there will be an error!

Notice that: Even if you input your name and surname whether uppercase or lowercase, output format will be "Name SURNAME".
