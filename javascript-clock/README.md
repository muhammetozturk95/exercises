# javascriptclock

This is my first Javascript project on Kodluyoruz-Front End Web Development course!

In this project;

To begin with, you will see an alert that asks your name. After you write your name and click OK, you will see your name and current date and hour. Notice that, even if you write your name in lowercase, you will see that first letter is always uppercase.
