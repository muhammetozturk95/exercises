# toggle-password-visibility

## **1. General**

This project is a basic javascript practice for me. In this practise, I created a simple form that adds your username to the userlist below when you type and submit your username and password.

## **3. Submit Successfully**

When you submitted a form successfully, you will see that your username add in userlist. At the same time, will see a toast message on top-left.

## **3. Invalid Input :/**
